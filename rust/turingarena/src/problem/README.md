A library to manage problems.
In our case, a "problem" has the following characteristics:

* describes a challenge, which requires the submission of a "solution",
* each solution, submitted by a single user or team, is evaluated independently from other submission,
* optionally, the evaluation assigns a numerical score to a solution,
  possibly separated into different "scored items",
* optionally, the evaluation generates a detailed feedback for the submission
  (e.g., explaining the assigned score).

Problems are meant to be used in contests, as well as in other context (e.g., a training website).
